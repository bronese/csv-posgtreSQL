# CSV-PostgreSQL

To-do:
- Fix login logic
- Add CSV regression data handling with numpy
	- learn how to socket numpy (death)
- Port the data into its necessary schemas

What works:
- CSV reading and tabulation on logged.html 
- In-browser editing of generated table 
- Saving of edited table back to host machine

What doesn't work:
- Login logic broke (unsure why!)
